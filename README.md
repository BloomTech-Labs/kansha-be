    *  DOMAIN = 'https://kansha.auth0.com/'
    *  SIGNING_CERT_URL = 'https://kansha.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json'
    *  S3_BUCKET_NAME = 'kansha-bucket'
    *  S3_ID = 'AKIA4QVBN53732IGKCEH'
    *  S3_KEY = 'njbvhUUh8bsHO9Z3MpZV84x10UKRSwfnLosIe+XQ'
    *  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'AKIA4QVBN53732IGKCEH'
